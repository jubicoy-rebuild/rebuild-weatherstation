## C.H.I.P powered weather station

Your task is to build a C.H.I.P powered weather station. Use sensors such as temperature, humidity or water sensor. 
Collect this data into database and provide a way for users to view this data. This can be custom web front-end, Android application or integration for some 3rd party tool.
You can also develope an API for fetching the data.

Focus on:
- Integrating different sensors to the environment, and reading them properly
- Choosing well suiting technology for storing the data
- Providing easy way for users to view the collected data
